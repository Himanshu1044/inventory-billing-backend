Inventory & Billing Management System (Backend)

This is a backend I made for managing products, customers, vendors, and transactions for a small business.
Itâ€™s built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Authentication is done with JWT and passwords are hashed using bcryptjs.

Features

1. Register/Login user

2. Add, update, delete, and search products

3. Manage customers and vendors

4. Record sales and purchases (stock updates automatically)

5. Simple reports for inventory and transactions

Setup
1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-link>
cd inventory-billing-backend
npm install

2. Create .env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/inventory_billing
JWT_SECRET=secret123
PORT=3000

3. Seed database
npm run seed


This will create:

Server runs at: http://localhost:8000
